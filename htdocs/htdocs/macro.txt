information available:- 
1.Weight of a person(in kgs)
2.Height of a person(in cms)
3.Age of the person.

REE:- defined as Resting Energy Expenditure which is basically the amount of calories one burns while body is in no movement mode.

For males:

10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) + 5 = REE

For females:

10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) – 161 = REE

movement expenditure or TDEE

Sedentary
Just normal everyday activity like a little walking, a couple flights of stairs, eating, talking etc. (REE X 1.2)

Light activity
Any activity that burns an additional 200-400 calories for females or 250-500 calories for males more than your sedentary amount. (REE x 1.375)

Moderate activity
Any activity that burns an additional 400-650 calories for females or 500-800 calories for males more than your sedentary amount. (REE x 1.55)

Very Active
Any activity that burns more than about 650 calories for females or more than 800 calories for males in addition to your sedentary amount. (REE x 1.725)

In order to lose weight:- Eat less than your calculated TDEE
In order to gain weight:- Eat more than your calculated TDEE
In order to maintain current weight:- Eat equal to your TDEE.

CALCULATION OF THE MACROS:-
Here are the calorie values for each macronutrient:

1g Protein = 4 Calories
1g Carbohydrate = 4 Calories
1g Fat = 9 Calories

PROTEIN:-
So if our individual weighs 195lbs (88 kg), and they are doing a moderate weight training program, then their protein intake will be 161 grams.

FATS:-
designate 25% of overall TDEE calories to fat.

To figure out 25% of Overall TDEE: 
3,250 Calories x 0.25 ( = 812.5 Calories) divided by 9 (9 calories per gram of fat) = 90.27g Fat (which I’d round down to 90 g).

We started with 3,250 Calories. We allocated 644 calories (161 g) to Protein, 813 calories (90 g) to Fat and we now allocate the rest, 1793 calories, to Carbohydrates.

Since 1g of Carb equals 4 calories we divide 1793 by 4 and get 448 g Carbohydrates.

Final Macros: 161 g Protein, Fat 90 g and 448 g Carbohydrates for this guy to maintain his current weight.
