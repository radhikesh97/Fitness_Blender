<h1> FITNESS FAQs </h1>
</center>
<b>How often should I workout?</b><br>
The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends getting 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week to achieve the health benefits, maintain current weight, and/or prevent weight gain.

Those who are overweight or obese, the ACSM recommends getting 250 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity each week. Results in studies have shown that is this is followed, weight loss can be significant.

Just a heads up: moderate intensity is where you are out of breath a little but you can hold a conversation while performing the exercise.<br><br>

<b>How do I know how much weight I should be lifting?</b><br>
Repetitions are key. Weight lifters should do 10-12 reps per muscle of their choice, and the weight used varies based on your fitness level. The final repetition is the one to pay attention to. If the 10th repetition is difficult, decrease the weight. If the 12th repetition is too easy, increase the weight.

The Center for Disease Control recommends strength training all the major muscles 2-3 times each week. Remember to exercise large muscle groups on non-consecutive days (upper body Monday â€“ Wednesday, lower body Tuesday and Thursday).<br><br>

<b>Are abdominal exercises effective if I want to lose extra fat around my stomach?</b><br>
No. Abdominal exercises are great for strengthening your core and back but there is no such thing as spot-reducing fat. Comprehensive cardiovascular workouts throughout the week are the most effective and will reduce the amount of fat that has accumulated on the body.<br><br>

<b>How many calories are burned while walking or jogging one mile?</b><br>
On average, the caloric expenditure per 100 pounds of body weight per mile is 62 calories. So if a person weighs 200 pounds, they would burn approximately 124 calories while walking or jogging.<br><br>

<b>I have been working out for a while now and stopped losing weight. What is happening?</b><br>
More than likely, you have hit a plateau. This means that your body has become used to the activity you have been doing to lose weight. Our bodies are smart machines and become very efficient over time when the same activity is performed.

To challenge your body, do a variety of exercises. If you like to run or walk, increase your speed every 2 minutes to increase your heart rate even more. For example, walk 2 minutes, run 2 minute, and repeat for 20-30 minutes. For runners, run 2 minutes at your normal speed then sprint for 1 minute and repeat for 20-30 minutes.<br><br>
